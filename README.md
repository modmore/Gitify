Gitify
======

The goal of Gitify is to provide a **two-way sync** of data typically stored in the MODX database, making it versionable with Git. To do this, it creates a representation of MODX objects in files. These files follow a certain [human and machine friendly format](https://gist.github.com/Mark-H/5acafdc1c364f70fa4e7), built from a block of YAML, followed by a separator, and then the main content (if there's a specific content field) below that.

The project configuration, which determines what data is written to file and build to the database, is stored in a `.gitify` file in the project root.

## Upgrading to v2

Gitify v2 brings updated dependencies, additional functionality, and easier installation/updates via Composer.

The data file structure is unchanged, so you can safely update to v2. 

1. To upgrade **with the intention of contributing to Gitify**, you can keep your exiting git installation. 
   1. Bring it up to date with the master branch (`git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master`, or `git fetch upstream && git reset --hard upstream/master`)
   2. Install updated dependencies (`composer install`)
   3. Update your `$PATH` to point to the `bin` directory. This may be in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file. 
2. To upgrade **simply to use Gitify**, it's recommended to remove the v1 git-based installation completely, and instead install Gitify globally with Composer as described in the installation section below.

**Important to know:**

- Gitify v2 is now compatible with Gitify Watch v2. Make sure you've upgraded to the latest version.
- The minimum PHP version has been increased to 7.2.5.
- `Gitify` has changed to `gitify` and is now in a /bin subdirectory.

## Installation

````bash 
composer global require modmore/gitify:^2
````

If that does not make `gitify` available on your path, add the output of `composer global config bin-dir --absolute` to your path (i.e. in the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file on Mac/Linux).

To update, use `composer global update modmore/gitify`. 

Alternatively, you can install Gitify local to a project with `composer require modmore/gitify:^2`. In that case you'll need to use `vendor/bin/gitify` as the command. 

When installing an alpha/dev version, if you haven't modified your global composer config before, it's possible you'll 
get an error message pertaining to your minimum-stability setting. (Composer defaults to stable, and we want an unstable version!)
To fix this, you'll need to set your global minimum stability with the following command:
```
composer global config minimum-stability alpha
```

### Manual Installation

Use the manual installation to build from source, useful if you intend to help make Gitify better.

````bash
$ git clone https://github.com/modmore/Gitify.git Gitify
$ cd Gitify
$ composer install --no-dev
$ chmod +x bin/gitify
````

Please see [the Installation documentation](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Open_Source/Gitify/Installation/index.html) for more details.

## Docker Usage

### Example usage:

```
docker build -t gitify docker
docker run --rm -v "src:/var/www/html" gitify help
```

### Example docker-compose configuration:

``` yaml
version: '3.1'

services:

  [...]

  gitify:
    build: docker 
    volumes:
      - "./src:/var/www/html"
```

Notice: gitify's container needs to be able to access the database and the sourcecode of ModX.

## Documentation

[Check the modmore Gitify documentation!](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Open_Source/Gitify/index.html) It contains information about the available commands and the way you would go about setting up a suitable workflow.

Please feel free to contribute to the wiki by editing existing pages, or adding new pages with extra information not covered elsewhere yet.

## Changes & History

Gitify adheres to [semver](http://semver.org). As we are before v1 right now, expect breaking changes and refactorings before the API stabilises.

For changes, please see the commit log or the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
