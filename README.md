Gitify
======

The goal of Gitify is to provide a **two-way sync** of data typically stored in the MODX database, making it versionable with Git. To do this, it creates a representation of MODX objects in files. These files follow a certain [human and machine friendly format](https://gist.github.com/Mark-H/5acafdc1c364f70fa4e7), built from a block of YAML, followed by a separator, and then the main content (if there's a specific content field) below that.

The project configuration, which determines what data is written to file and build to the database, is stored in a `.gitify` file in the project root.

## Quick Installation

```` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/modmore/Gitify.git Gitify
$ cd Gitify
$ composer install
$ chmod +x Gitify
````

Please see [the Installation wiki](https://github.com/modmore/Gitify/wiki/1.-Installation) for more details.

## Docker Usage

### Example usage:

```
docker build -t gitify docker
docker run --rm -v "src:/var/www/html" gitify help
```

### Example docker-compose configuration:

``` yaml
version: '3.1'

services:

  [...]

  gitify:
    build: docker 
    volumes:
      - "./src:/var/www/html"
```

Notice: gitify's container needs to be able to access the database and the sourcecode of ModX.

## Documentation

[Check the Wiki!](https://github.com/modmore/Gitify/wiki) It contains information about the available commands and the way you would go about setting up a suitable workflow.

Please feel free to contribute to the wiki by editing existing pages, or adding new pages with extra information not covered elsewhere yet.

## Changes & History

Gitify adheres to [semver](http://semver.org). As we are before v1 right now, expect breaking changes and refactorings before the API stabilises.

For changes, please see the commit log or the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
