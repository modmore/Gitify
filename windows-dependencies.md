# Here are some added instructions for getting Gitify to work on Windows
Here are the Windows dependencies in order to get the script to execute properly. They must be installed and their bin folders have to be added to the Windows PATH environment variable in the Advanced System Settings screen:

* compatible unzip capabilities - http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/gnuwin32/unzip/5.51-1/unzip-5.51-1-bin.zip
* compatible linux bsh commands - http://superb-dca2.dl.sourceforge.net/project/win-bash/shell-complete/latest/shell.w32-ix86.zip
* compatible curl support - http://www.confusedbycode.com/curl/#downloads
* curl needs the msvc redistributable in order to function (install this before curl) - https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/3/F/93FCF1E7-E6A4-478B-96E7-D4B285925B00/vc_redist.x64.exe
* windows composer support - https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe

Once those are completed, the rest of the instructions do work.
